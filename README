unoconv converts any document format that OpenOffice can import, to any
document format that OpenOffice can export.

unoconv uses the OpenOffice's UNO bindings for non-interactive conversion
of documents.

unoconv tries to start an oofice instance that it then uses and
destroys. However the success rate of starting and stopping this
ooffice instance depends on some outside factors.

You can always start an instance yourself at the default port 2002 and
then use unoconv until you're finished using it and then stop it.

    unoconv --listener &
    unoconv -b pdf *.odt
    unoconv -b doc *.odt
    unoconv -b html *.odt
    kill -15 %-

Also possible is to use a listener or OpenOffice instance that accepts
conntections on another system and use it from unoconv remotely. This
way the conversion tasks are performed on a dedicated system instead
of on the client system.
